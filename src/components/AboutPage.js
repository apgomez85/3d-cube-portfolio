      <p>
        I'm Adrian Gomez, a Web Developer based in Southern California. I have
        found my passion in web development and design. I love tech and problem
        solving in all aspects. Right now, I specialize in the MERN stack and
        all the bits and bytes in between, but will gladly explore other
        avenues. Similar to the tech world, I am always in development.
